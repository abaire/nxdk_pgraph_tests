nxdk_pgraph_tests
====

Various tests for nv2a rendering.

Based on code from https://github.com/Ernegien/nxdk/tree/test/texture-formats/samples/texture-formats

Golden test results from XBOX hardware are [available here](https://github.com/abaire/nxdk_pgraph_tests_golden_results)

## Usage

Tests will be executed automatically if no gamepad input is given within an initial timeout.

Individual tests may be executed via the menu.

### Test configuration

Tests can optionally be determined via a configuration file loaded from the XBOX. The file follows a simple line-based
format.

* A test suite and all of the tests within will be enabled if the suite name appears on a single line.
* A single test within an enabled suite may be disabled by prefixing its name with a `-` after the line containing the
  test suite containing it.
* Any line starting with `#` will be ignored.

The names used are the same as the names that appear in the `nxdk_praph_tests` menu.

If the entire file is empty (or commented out), it will be ignored and all tests will be enabled.

For example:

```
ThisTestSuiteIsEnabled
-ExceptThisTest

# This is ignored.
```

In the default release build, the test suite will look for this file in
`e:/nxdk_pgraph_tests/pgraph_tests.cnf` and `d:\pgraph_tests.cnf`, taking
whichever is found first. If neither is found, all tests will be executed.

The default release build will also write a template of this file called
`config.cnf` (see the `DUMP_CONFIG_FILE` Makefile variable).

### Progress logging

If the `ENABLE_PROGRESS_LOG` Makefile variable is set to `y`, a progress log
named `pgraph_progress_log.txt` will be saved in the output directory. This may
be useful when trying to track down emulator crashes (e.g., due to unimplemented
features).

### Controls

DPAD:

* Up - Move the menu cursor up. Inside of a test, go to the previous test in the active suite.
* Down - Move the menu cursor down. Inside of a test, go to the previous test in the active suite.
* Left - Move the menu cursor up by half a page.
* Right - Move the menu cursor down by half a page.
* A - Enter a submenu or test. Inside of a test, re-run the test.
* B - Go up one menu or leave a test. If pressed on the root menu, exit the application.
* X - Run all tests for the current suite.
* Y - Toggle saving of results and multi-frame rendering.
* Start - Enter a submenu or test.
* Back - Go up one menu or leave a test. If pressed on the root menu, exit the application.
* Black - Exit the application.

## Build prerequisites

This project uses [nv2a-vsh](https://pypi.org/project/nv2a-vsh/) to assemble some of the vertex shaders for tests.
It can be installed via `pip3 install nv2a-vsh --upgrade`.

This test suite requires some modifications to the pbkit used by the nxdk in order to operate.

To facilitate this, the nxdk is included as a submodule of this project, referencing the
`cmake_pgraph_tester` branch from https://github.com/abaire/nxdk.

This project should be cloned with the `--recursive` flag to pull the submodules and their submodules,
after the fact this can be achieved via `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

As of July 2023, the nxdk's CMake implementation requires bootstrapping before it may be used. To facilitate this, run
the `prewarm-nxdk.sh` script from this project's root directory. It will navigate into the `nxdk` subdir and build all
of the sample projects, triggering the creation of the `nxdk` libraries needed for the toolchain and for this project.

### Building with CLion

The CMake target can be configured to use the toolchain from the nxdk:

* CMake options

  `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<absolute_path_to_this_project>/third_party/nxdk/share/toolchain-nxdk.cmake`

* Environment

  `NXDK_DIR=<absolute_path_to_this_project>/third_party/nxdk`

On macOS you may also have to modify `PATH` in the `Environment` section such that a homebrew version of LLVM
is preferred over Xcode's (to supply `dlltool`).

#### Example settings

Assuming that this project has been checked out at `/development/pgraph_tester`:

* CMake options: `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/development/pgraph_tester/third_party/nxdk/share/toolchain-nxdk.cmake`
* Environment: `NXDK_DIR=/development/pgraph_tester/third_party/nxdk`

## Adding new tests

### Using nv2a log events from [xemu](https://xemu.app/)

1. Enable tracing of nv2a log events as normal (see xemu documentation) and
   exercise the event of interest within the game.
1. Duplicate an existing test as a skeleton.
1. Add the duplicated test to `CMakeLists.txt` and `main.cpp` (please preserve
   alphabetical ordering if possible).
1. Use [nv2a_to_pbkit](https://github.com/abaire/nv2a_to_pbkit) to get a rough
   set of pbkit invocations duplicating the behavior from the log. Take the
   interesting portions of the converted output and put them into the body of
   the test. You may wish to utilize some of the helper methods from `TestHost`
   and similar classes rather than using the raw output to improve readability.

### Writing nv2a vertex shaders in assembly

See [the README in the nv2a_vsh_asm repository](https://github.com/abaire/nv2a_vsh_asm) for an overview.

`*.vsh` files are assembed via the `generate_nv2a_vshinc_files` function in CMakeLists.txt. Each vsh file produces a
corresponding `.vshinc` file that contains a C-style list of 32-bit integers containing the vertex shader operations.
This file is intended to be included from test source files to initialize a constant array which may then be used to
populate a `VertexShaderProgram` via `SetShaderOverride`.

For example:

```c++
// Note that the VertexShaderProgram does not copy this data, so it is important that it remain in scope throughout
// the use of the VertexShaderProgram object.
static const uint32_t kPassthroughVsh[] = {
#include "passthrough.vshinc"
};

// ...

  auto shader = std::make_shared<VertexShaderProgram>();
  shader->SetShaderOverride(kPassthroughVsh, sizeof(kPassthroughVsh));
  host_.SetVertexShaderProgram(shader);

```

Uniform values may then be set via the `VertexShaderProgram::SetUniform*` series of functions. By default, the 0th
uniform will be available in the shader as `c96`.

For example, a shader that takes a 4-element vertex might have the code:

```asm
#vertex vector 96
```

which would be populated via

```c++
  shader->shader->SetUniformF(0, -1.f, 1.5f, 0.f, 1.f);
```

## Running with CLion

### On xemu

Create a build target

1. Create a new `Embedded GDB Server` target
1. Set the Target to `nxdk_pgraph_tests_xiso`
1. Set the Executable to `nxdk_pgraph_tests`
1. Set `Download executable` to `Never`
1. Set `'target remote' args` to `127.0.0.1:1234`
1. Set `GDB Server` to the path to the xemu binary
1. Set `GDB Server args` to `-s -S -dvd_path "$CMakeCurrentBuildDir$/xiso/nxdk_pgraph_tests.iso"` (the `-S` is
   optional and will cause xemu to wait for the debugger to connnect)
1. Under `Advanced GDB Server Options`
    1. Set "Working directory" to `$ProjectFileDir$`
    1. On macOS, set "Environment variables"
       to `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/<the full path to your xemu.app bundle>/Contents/Libraries/<the architecture for your platform, e.g., arm64>`
    3. Set "Reset command" to `Never`

To capture DbgPrint, additionally append `-device lpc47m157 -serial tcp:127.0.0.1:9091` to `GDB Server args` and use
something like [pykdclient](https://github.com/abaire/pykdclient).

NOTE: If you see a failure due to "Remote target doesn't support qGetTIBAddr packet", check the GDB output to make sure
that the `.gdbinit` file was successfully loaded.

## Deploying with [xbdm_gdb_bridge](https://github.com/abaire/xbdm_gdb_bridge)

To create a launch configuration that deploys the devhost to an XBDM-enabled XBOX (devkit) with debugging enabled:

1. Upload the full set of resource files to the XBOX

   This can be done with [xbdm_gdb_bridge binary](https://github.com/abaire/xbdm_gdb_bridge) and a `CMake Application`
   target.
    1. Create a new `CMake Application` target
    2. Set `Target` to `nxdk_pgraph_tests_xiso`
    3. Set `Executable` to the full path to the [xbdm_gdb_bridge binary](https://github.com/abaire/xbdm_gdb_bridge)
       binary
    4. Set `Program arguments`
       to `192.168.80.87 -v3 -- mkdir e:\$CMakeCurrentTargetName$ && putfile $CMakeCurrentBuildDir$/xbe/xbe_file e:\$CMakeCurrentTargetName$ -f`
    5. Run the target. You will need to do this any time the resources are changed. The XBE can be uploaded as part of
       the debug step.

1. Create a new `Embedded GDB Server` run config.
    1. Set the "Target" to `nxdk_pgraph_tests`
    1. Set the "Executable binary" to `nxdk_pgraph_tests`
    1. Set "Download executable" to `Never`
    1. Set "'target remote' args" to `localhost:1999`
    1. Set "GDB Server" to the full path to the [xbdm_gdb_bridge binary](https://github.com/abaire/xbdm_gdb_bridge)
       binary
    1. Set "GDB Server args"
       to `<YOUR_XBOX_IP> -s -- mkdir e:\$CMakeCurrentTargetName$ && putfile $CMakeCurrentBuildDir$/xbe/xbe_file/default.xbe e:\$CMakeCurrentTargetName$ -f && gdb :1999 e:\$CMakeCurrentTargetName$`
    1. Under "Advanced GDB Server Options"
        1. Set "Reset command" to `Never`
        2. If CLion times out connecting to the GDB server, increase the `Startup delay` setting to give the XBE file
           upload more time to complete. A timeout of 10000 - 15000 milliseconds may be a good start.
